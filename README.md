# AppDynamics Monitoring Extension for use with AWS Classic Elastic Load Balancers

## Use Case

Captures Classic ELB statistics from Amazon CloudWatch and displays them in the AppDynamics Metric Browser.

## Prerequisites

1. Please give the following permissions to the account being used to with the extension.

- **cloudwatch:ListMetrics**
- **cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics**

2. In order to use this extension, you do need a
   [Standalone JAVA Machine Agent](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO44/Standalone+Machine+Agents)
   or [SIM Agent](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO44/Server+Visibility).
   For more details on downloading these products, please visit [here](https://download.appdynamics.com/).

3. The extension needs to be able to connect to AWS CloudWatch in order to collect and send metrics.
   To do this, you will have to either establish a remote connection in between the extension and the product,
   or have an agent on the same machine running the product in order for the extension to collect and send the metrics.

**Agent Compatibility:**

**Note: This extension is compatible with Machine Agent version 4.5.13 or later.**

1. If you are seeing warning messages while starting the Machine Agent, update the http-client and http-core JARs in `{MACHINE_AGENT_HOME}/monitorsLibs` to `httpclient-4.5.9` and `httpcore-4.4.12` to make this warning go away.

2. To make this extension work on Machine Agent < 4.5.13, the http-client and http-core JARs in `{MACHINE_AGENT_HOME}/monitorsLibs` need to be updated to `httpclient-4.5.9` and `httpcore-4.4.12`.

## Installation

1. Run `mvn clean install` from aws-elb-monitoring-extension directory
2. Copy and unzip `AWSELBMonitor-<version>.zip` from `target` directory into `<machine_agent_dir>/monitors/`
3. Edit `config.yml` file in `AWSELBMonitor` and provide the required configuration (see Configuration section)
4. Restart the Machine Agent.

Please place the extension in the "**monitors**" directory of your Machine Agent installation directory.
Do not place the extension in the "**extensions**" directory of your Machine Agent installation directory.

## Configuration

### config.yml

In order to use the extension, you need to update the config.yml file that is present in the extension folder.
The following is a step-by-step explanation of the configurable fields that are present in the `config.yml` file.

1.  If SIM is enabled, then use the following metricPrefix -

    `metricPrefix: "Custom Metrics|AWS ELB|"`

    Else, configure the "**COMPONENT_ID**" under which the metrics need to be reported. This can be done by changing the value of `<COMPONENT_ID>` in
    `metricPrefix: "Server|Component:<COMPONENT_ID>|Custom Metrics|AWS ELB|"`.

    For example,

    ```
    metricPrefix: "Server|Component:100|Custom Metrics|AWS ELB|"
    ```

2.  Provide **accessKey**(required) and **secretKey**(required) of your account(s), also provide **displayAccountName**(any name that represents your account) and
    **regions**(required). If you are running this extension inside an EC2 instance which has **IAM profile** configured then you don't have to configure **accessKey** and **secretKey** values, extension will use **IAM profile** to authenticate. You can provide multiple accounts and regions as below -

    ```
    accounts:
      - awsAccessKey: "XXXXXXXX1"
        awsSecretKey: "XXXXXXXXXX1"
        displayAccountName: "TestAccount_1"
        regions: ["us-east-1","us-west-1","us-west-2"]

      - awsAccessKey: "XXXXXXXX2"
        awsSecretKey: "XXXXXXXXXX2"
        displayAccountName: "TestAccount_2"
        regions: ["eu-central-1","eu-west-1"]
    ```

3.  If you want to encrypt the **awsAccessKey** and **awsSecretKey** then follow the "Credentials Encryption" section and provide the encrypted values in **awsAccessKey** and **awsSecretKey**. Configure `enableDecryption` of `credentialsDecryptionConfig` to `true` and provide the encryption key in `encryptionKey`.
    For example,
    ```
    #Encryption key for Encrypted password.
     credentialsDecryptionConfig:
       enableDecryption: "false"
       encryptionKey:
    ```
4.  Provide all valid proxy information if you use it. If not, leave this section as is.
    ```
    proxyConfig:
      host:
      port:
      username:
      password:
    ```
5.  To report metrics from specific LoadBalance ELB values, configure the `namespace` section.
    Namespace ELB are `AWS/ELB` , `AWS/ApplicationELB` and `AWS/NetworkELB`

        ```
         namespace: "AWS/ELB"
        ```

6.  To report metrics from specific dimension values, configure the `dimesion` section.
    Dimensions for AWS ELB are `AvailabilityZone` and `LoadBalancerName`.
    Dimensions for AWS ApplicationELB are `AvailabilityZone`, `LoadBalancer` and `TargetGroup`.
    Dimensions for AWS NetworkELB are `AvailabilityZone`, `LoadBalancer` and `TargetGroup`.
    For example to report metrics only from only `AvailabilityZone` dimension with value `Sample`, configure `dimensions` as below -

        ```
         dimensions:
          - name: "AvailabilityZone"
            displayName: "AvailabilityZone"
            values: ["Sample"]
        ```
        If you would like to monitor more than one dimension, you can do the following :

        ```
        dimensions:
          - name: "LoadBalancerName"
            displayName: "LoadBalancer Name"
            values: ["Dev", "tools"]
          - name: "AvailabilityZone"
            displayName: "AvailabilityZone"
            values: ["Sample"]
        ```

    If these fields are left empty, none of your instances will be monitored.
    In order to monitor everything under a dimension, you can simply use ".\*" to pull everything from your AWS Environment.

7.  Configure the metrics section.

    For configuring the metrics, the following properties can be used:

    | Property          | Default value | Possible values                 | Description                                                                                                     |
    | :---------------- | :------------ | :------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | alias             | metric name   | Any string                      | The substitute name to be used in the metric browser instead of metric name.                                    |
    | statType          | "ave"         | "AVERAGE", "SUM", "MIN", "MAX"  | AWS configured values as returned by API                                                                        |
    | aggregationType   | "AVERAGE"     | "AVERAGE", "SUM", "OBSERVATION" | [Aggregation qualifier](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO44/Build+a+Monitoring+Extension+Using+Java)     |
    | timeRollUpType    | "AVERAGE"     | "AVERAGE", "SUM", "CURRENT"     | [Time roll-up qualifier](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO44/Build+a+Monitoring+Extension+Using+Java)    |
    | clusterRollUpType | "INDIVIDUAL"  | "INDIVIDUAL", "COLLECTIVE"      | [Cluster roll-up qualifier](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO44/Build+a+Monitoring+Extension+Using+Java) |
    | multiplier        | 1             | Any number                      | Value with which the metric needs to be multiplied.                                                             |
    | convert           | null          | Any key value map               | Set of key value pairs that indicates the value to which the metrics need to be transformed. eg: UP:0, DOWN:1   |
    | delta             | false         | true, false                     | If enabled, gives the delta values of metrics instead of actual values.                                         |

    For example,

    ```
    - name: "ConditionalCheckFailedRequests"
      alias: "ConditionalCheckFailedRequests"
      statType: "ave"
      delta: false
      multiplier: 1
      aggregationType: "AVERAGE"
      timeRollUpType: "AVERAGE"
      clusterRollUpType: "INDIVIDUAL"
    ```

    **All these metric properties are optional, and the default value shown in the table is applied to the metric(if a property has not been specified) by default.**

8.  For several services AWS CloudWatch does not instantly update the metrics but it goes back in time to update that information.
    This delay sometimes can take upto 5 minutes. The extension runs every minute(Detailed) or every 5 minutes (Basic) and gets the latest value at that time.
    There may be a case where the extension may miss the value before CloudWatch updates it. In order to make sure we don't do that,
    the extension has the ability to look for metrics during a certain interval, where we already have set it to default at 5 minutes but you can
    change it as per your requirements.
    `metricsTimeRange: startTimeInMinsBeforeNow: 10 endTimeInMinsBeforeNow: 5`
9.  This field is set as per the defaults suggested by AWS. You can change this if your limit is different.
    ```
    getMetricStatisticsRateLimit: 400
    ```
10. The maximum number of retry attempts for failed requests that can be retried.


    ```
    maxErrorRetrySize: 3
    ```

11. CloudWatch can be used in two formats, Basic and Detailed. You can specify how you would like to run the extension by specifying the chosen format here.
    By default, the extension is set to Basic, which makes the extension run every 5 minutes.
    Refer https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-cloudwatch-new.html for more information.

        ```
        #Allowed values are Basic and Detailed.
        # Basic will fire CloudWatch API calls every 5 minutes
        # Detailed will fire CloudWatch API calls every 1 minutes
        cloudWatchMonitoring: "Basic"
        ```

Please avoid using tab (\t) when editing yaml files. Please copy all the contents of the config.yml file and go to [Yaml Validator](http://www.yamllint.com/) . On reaching the website, paste the contents and press the “Go” button on the bottom left.  
If you get a valid output, that means your formatting is correct and you may move on to the next step.

## Metrics

Typical metric path: **Application Infrastructure Performance|\<Tier\>|Custom Metrics|Amazon ELB|\<Account Name\>|\<Region\>|Table Name|\<table name\>** followed by the metrics defined in the link below:
